A browser wrapper, that can be used to read articles from websites, filtering all the garbage. Basically, this fetches the URL, extracts the useful content, blocking garbage like ads, subscription prompts and other nuisances out. This was implemented both as an excercise in React Native and to have something to read news and articles without annoying content.
